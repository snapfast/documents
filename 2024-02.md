## 11th writing

The days are very slow, I have realised that I enjoy slowness. I will improve my work ethics, and discipline.

I just downloaded Jaimini Astrology book by K N Rao. I will read it and will try to understand the perspective with which it is written. Previous night I was reading lots of similar books by various authors. Also went down the rabbit hole of buying another devices just to read these books. Maybe, there is not a need for tablet like device, would rather buy a macbook with M1/M2 chip for personal use.

I have to learn writing techniques, my general way that I write is just talking to my self. The sense is very similar to how I talk in my head. However, I think this is not very optimal for someone reading my text who has never been inside my head, i.e. no human. Hope this style get modified into something sub liminal that I personally would like reading this author ;P
