Understanding Masturbation and Spiritual Energy

Cells of the body have charge in the body. The small amount of charge gets removed from the cells. This accumulates, builds up to a large amounts. Then it causes organ damage or brain damage if high amount of energy is lost. -15eV is the voltage required to run healthy cell in a body. Higher energy helps heal, more energy you have in cells(energy which is not wasted).

There are various ways you can lose energy, i.e. masturbation, playing video games, reading lots of books, ..., marriage, education is for working in hell's kitchen.

Think before you make decisions, and make them without regret. Floating decisions will make you drain energy, better make decision and do what you think, then plan, and stick to it. VIRY is power that can handle all the things in life.

Do not get involved with other people, the chakara become lose and body loses VIRY. Developing the mooladhara chakra will improve life. **Orgasm is necessary, but ejaculation is not.** Rise and fall of energy is the practice, breaking through the top of orgasm and ejaculating will make you weak and diseased.

Satisfying a women is a responsibility of a man. 

People with under developed sexual energy are not disciplined and it makes them not follow a routine. Women who do not practice masturbation(without ejaculation) face lose of sexual urge(electricity) completely and causes disease in the body.

If practiced properly, the orgasm starts happening way before the actual ejaculation. This has to be practiced and good body and mind can do this easily and still feel amazing without ejaculation. You will get amazing orgasm without low in the energy.

Female has lose of energy in the injustice feeling, they feel if something is not just, they feel it inside. Understand the rules of nature and help them guide you, instead of pushing your point of view on the nature of body. Listen to your body.
Power is needed to get justice, if you are powerless, don't waste time in thinking about the injustice. This injustice will lose your energy.

Physical body needs VIRY(OJAS), Mental Body needs TEJAS.

Anahata charka is magnetic field. Swathisthan charka is currency of the Genitals.

Manipura charka gets support of other people.

Notes for Shani Lagna:  
Shanishchara (Slow moving)

Shani in lagna is sitting on the head of the person. The thinking is faster but the decision and understanding an situation will be slowed down.

Strong position of the strong (exaltation, sasa yoga), otherwise this is a negative position.
In positive situation, lot of hard work can be done with huge amount of patience. It makes you learn and understand life with experience only.

Have stoop in the back, looks down on the ground, can have back bone issues.
Takes time to understand any situation, however, it gives best solution of any problem, listen to your Shani friends. If they take resolve, the permanence of the resolve will stick, it will get all the data and strong to prove some points.

Hands-on job is main thing that they like, being present with the people. Agriculture is the profession of the Shani. Bad saturn people should respect the farmer, get your vegetables and things from the direct farmer. Visit his farm, and pay directly to his hand. Best remedy.

Iron, black smith, all hard tough jobs are related to Shani people.  Helpers in the people, taking care of the elder people, Nurse, guards, sweepers and all other people belong to Shani.

Troubles to Saturn always come back, so be humble.

If a sasa yoga, people directly go to managerial level, and achieve very high positions of companies and government.

Procrastination is not good for the Shani lagna. Wear a copper ring in third finger, do surya arga.

The days are very slow, I have realised that I enjoy slowness. I will improve my work ethics, and discipline.

I just downloaded Jaimini Astrology book by K N Rao. I will read it and will try to understand the perspective with which it is written. Previous night I was reading lots of similar books by various authors. Also went down the rabbit hole of buying another devices just to read these books. Maybe, there is not a need for tablet like device, would rather buy a macbook with M1/M2 chip for personal use.

I have to learn writing techniques, my general way that I write is just talking to my self. The sense is very similar to how I talk in my head. However, I think this is not very optimal for someone reading my text who has never been inside my head, i.e. no human. Hope this style get modified into something sub liminal that I personally would like reading this author ;P
