Notes for Shani Lagna:  
Shanishchara (Slow moving)

Shani in lagna is sitting on the head of the person. The thinking is faster but the decision and understanding an situation will be slowed down.

Strong position of the strong (exaltation, sasa yoga), otherwise this is a negative position.
In positive situation, lot of hard work can be done with huge amount of patience. It makes you learn and understand life with experience only.

Have stoop in the back, looks down on the ground, can have back bone issues.
Takes time to understand any situation, however, it gives best solution of any problem, listen to your Shani friends. If they take resolve, the permanence of the resolve will stick, it will get all the data and strong to prove some points.

Hands-on job is main thing that they like, being present with the people. Agriculture is the profession of the Shani. Bad saturn people should respect the farmer, get your vegetables and things from the direct farmer. Visit his farm, and pay directly to his hand. Best remedy.

Iron, black smith, all hard tough jobs are related to Shani people.  Helpers in the people, taking care of the elder people, Nurse, guards, sweepers and all other people belong to Shani.

Troubles to Saturn always come back, so be humble.

If a sasa yoga, people directly go to managerial level, and achieve very high positions of companies and government.

Procrastination is not good for the Shani lagna. Wear a copper ring in third finger, do surya arga.

The days are very slow, I have realised that I enjoy slowness. I will improve my work ethics, and discipline.

I just downloaded Jaimini Astrology book by K N Rao. I will read it and will try to understand the perspective with which it is written. Previous night I was reading lots of similar books by various authors. Also went down the rabbit hole of buying another devices just to read these books. Maybe, there is not a need for tablet like device, would rather buy a macbook with M1/M2 chip for personal use.

I have to learn writing techniques, my general way that I write is just talking to my self. The sense is very similar to how I talk in my head. However, I think this is not very optimal for someone reading my text who has never been inside my head, i.e. no human. Hope this style get modified into something sub liminal that I personally would like reading this author ;P
