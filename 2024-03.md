## 15th March

Last 30 days were the so-fucking insane, my life just took 180 degrees turn. I went to Bhubaneshwar in search of girl, god, and something bigger in life. I can't exactly say, what I was trying to do. But, everywhere I went, I found purpose, I found power. Things that I didn't know I would like doing and eventually I liked them. 

Some supernatural things happened, some miracles were seen. My heart is at rest now, it went on a rollercoaster for 1 month straight. I have decided to focus back on myself.
