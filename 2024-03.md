## 15th

Last 30 days were the so-fucking insane, my life just took 180 degrees turn. I went to Bhubaneshwar in search of girl, god, and something bigger in life. I can't exactly say, what I was trying to do. But, everywhere I went, I found purpose, I found power. Things that I didn't know I would like doing and eventually I liked them. 

Some supernatural things happened, some miracles were seen. My heart is at rest now, it went on a rollercoaster for 1 month straight. I have decided to focus back on myself.

Something I want to blabber, maybe sense or nonsense

where you look, you can't see
the looks of too many, cannot condition my mind to understand the world
one look, and you are done for your life
eating food... I can't even write.


WTF>>>>>> am I feeling ?

I feel I need someone, but I don't
This desire for something inside missing, someone is away from me
I haven't met that one yet, when I meet, I may have no more questions
No words, no suprises, just stay
stay as long as sun shines and moon sunders the night

Lets study some actual stuff, this is just another pitstop where I stop by to puke.
